This is a very nice job, you nailed it.

It appears that you have fairly complete coverage.  You might consider
putting in a couple of "negative tests" to check that if there are errors
that can be forced they are handled gracefully.

Other than that, I think you have covered it well enough.

I notice that you used the outline from CMSI 401, even though this is not
that class.  The outline for CMSI 402 is different.  Don't worry about it,
it's not a hill to die on.

Nice work!

So far for the semester:
Proposal:      5.0  out of  5.0  points
Requirements: 15.0  out of 15.0  points
Test Plan:    15.0  out of 15.0  points
Homework 1:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Homework 2:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Particip.:     1.5  out of  1.5  points
              43.18 out of 43.18 points = 100.0% which is an A-plus

Keep it up!
